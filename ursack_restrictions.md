# Ursack restrictions

I went over this subject at carefully at length with several rangers last summer
and got a definitive answer: It does not matter if you hike through a canister
required area but don’t sleep there, or if there happens to be food lockers in
that area. If you even SET FOOT in one of the areas, you must have a canister.
That is the law, and that is how they are policing it. I don’t think it is
realistic to do the JMT and not pass though the extensive Rae Lakes area.

I also uncovered one incorrect notion that exists in several posts and I think
it was also on one official web page I found: It is not true that there are any
lockers that are “reserved” for thru hikers. Anyone can use a locker, anywhere.

Yes, Ursacks are allowed along the rest of the JMT, with the exceptions of: YNP,
the extended Rae Lakes region, and the area around Whitney.  Here’s a map of
SEKI’s rules:

Bear Resistant Canister Regulation
Subparagraph 190.13(f)(3)(xiv) of Title 6 of the New York Code, Rule and
Regulation (6 NYCRR) (effected August 24, 2005) states that no person "during
the period April 1 through November 30, no overnight camper in the Eastern High
Peaks Zone shall fail to use bear-resistant canisters for the storage of all
food, food containers, garbage, and toiletries."

6 NYCRR Paragraph 190.13(b)(2) defines a bear-resistant canister as "a
commercially made container constructed of solid, non-pliable material
manufactured for the specific purpose of resisting entry by bears."

6 NYCRR Paragraph 190.13(b)(6) defines an overnight camper as "a person who
stays or intends to stay in the Eastern High Peaks Zone during the night."

6 NYCRR Paragraph 190.13(b)(4) defines the Eastern High Peaks Zone as "that
portion of the High Peaks Wilderness Area located to the east of the ridge line
immediately west of the Indian Pass Trail."
